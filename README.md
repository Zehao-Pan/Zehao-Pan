## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on PyTorch project predicting time series data. 

- ðŸŒ± I have finished several regression and machine learning projects as part of Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate.

- I am currently learning data structure and algorithms.

- My favorite concept lately is "algorithms as technology".

- I like physics and have published several papers in physics journals. You can find my publications here: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=M0Gb3O8AAAAJ&hl=en

- Fun fact: Because of to surface tension, the pressure inside a small water droplet, say one micron in diameter, is higher than one atmosphere pressure.
